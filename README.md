MIPS disasm
===========

This is a project to implement a MIPS machine code disassembler and then
and emulator, as based on the now defunc subject COMP20006, Programming the
Machine at the University of Melbourne (which I originally did quite
badly in...)

It's currently on a hiatus, but will get more attention in the Winter.
